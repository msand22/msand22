--->I do not have any previous coding experience.  I am taking this course because we live in a digital world and it seemed important to me to know how computers work.
Some of my other interterests include marine biology and environmental science as well as football and the NFL.  
Id like to learn about coding this year and I'm not sure what projects I would like to complete.
